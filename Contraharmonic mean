The contraharmonic mean is a type of statistical measure used in image processing and signal processing. It is particularly useful for filtering out noise in images and estimating the central value of a set of data points. The contraharmonic mean is denoted as \( Q_{\text{CHM}}(x) \) and is defined by the formula:

\[ Q_{\text{CHM}}(x) = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^{Q+1}}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^{Q}} \]

where:
- \( n \) is the number of data points,
- \( x_i \) is the \(i\)-th data point,
- \( Q \) is the order of the contraharmonic mean.

The contraharmonic mean is an extension of the arithmetic mean and is sensitive to the order \( Q \) chosen. Depending on the value of \( Q \), the contraharmonic mean exhibits different properties:

1. **When \( Q = -1 \): The contraharmonic mean becomes the harmonic mean, which is suitable for reducing the impact of outliers.

2. **When \( Q = 0 \): The contraharmonic mean becomes the arithmetic mean, which is less sensitive to outliers compared to the harmonic mean.

3. **When \( Q = 1 \): The contraharmonic mean becomes the quadratic mean or root mean square, which emphasizes larger values and is commonly used in signal processing.

4. **When \( Q = 2 \): The contraharmonic mean becomes the arithmetic mean of the squared values, which is often used for image processing, especially in the context of noise reduction.

The contraharmonic mean is particularly employed in image processing for noise reduction purposes, where it is used as a filter to reduce the impact of salt-and-pepper noise. By adjusting the order \( Q \), the filter can be tuned to be more biased toward eliminating either positive or negative outliers.

In summary, the contraharmonic mean is a statistical measure that is sensitive to the order parameter \( Q \) and finds applications in noise reduction, particularly in the context of image processing.
