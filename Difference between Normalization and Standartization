Normalization and standardization are both techniques used to preprocess numerical data before feeding it into a machine learning algorithm. They aim to make the data more suitable for the learning process, but they do so in slightly different ways.

Normalization:

In normalization, the data is rescaled so that it ranges from 0 to 1.
It is useful when the values of features vary widely in scale.
It is also helpful when the algorithm being used requires features to be on a similar scale.
Common normalization techniques include Min-Max scaling and feature scaling.
Standardization:

In standardization, the data is rescaled so that it has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
It is useful when the features have different units or different distributions.
It centers the data around 0, which is more suitable for many optimization algorithms.
It is less influenced by outliers compared to normalization.
Common standardization techniques include z-score normalization or feature scaling by the mean and standard deviation.
In summary, while both techniques aim to make the data more suitable for machine learning, normalization rescales the data to a specific range, while standardization centers the data around 0 with a unit standard deviation. The choice between the two depends on the specific characteristics of the data and the requirements of the machine learning algorithm being used.
