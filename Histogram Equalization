Histogram equalization is a technique used in image processing to enhance the contrast of an image by redistributing the intensity values. The goal is to make the histogram of the image more uniform, which can lead to a more visually appealing and detailed image. This technique is particularly useful when an image has a limited range of intensity values, causing it to appear washed out or lacking in contrast.

Here are the key steps involved in histogram equalization:

1. Compute the Histogram:**
   - Calculate the histogram of the input image. The histogram represents the distribution of pixel intensities in the image.

2. Compute the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF):
   - Compute the cumulative distribution function from the histogram. The CDF gives the cumulative sum of histogram values and represents the transformation to be applied.

3. Normalize the CDF:
   - Normalize the CDF to scale it to the range [0, 255] (or the dynamic range of the pixel values in the image). This step ensures that the new intensity values will be in a valid range.

4. Map Original Intensities to New Intensities:
   - Map the original intensity values of the pixels in the image to their corresponding values in the normalized CDF. This mapping effectively redistributes the pixel intensities to achieve a more uniform distribution.

5. Generate the Equalized Image:
   - Replace the original intensity values in the image with their corresponding values from the normalized CDF. This results in an equalized image with improved contrast.

The main advantage of histogram equalization is that it can enhance the visibility of details in images with poor contrast. It is especially effective when an image has a narrow intensity range, as it spreads out the intensity values across a broader range. However, it's worth noting that histogram equalization may also amplify the noise in the image.

Here's a simplified example of the process:

- Original Image Histogram:
  ```
  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9
  --------------------------------
  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
  --------------------------------
  ```

- Equalized Histogram (after applying histogram equalization):
  ```
  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9
  --------------------------------
  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
  --------------------------------
  ```

The equalized histogram is ideally more spread out, and the equalized image should have improved contrast. Histogram equalization is a common technique in image processing and computer vision applications for enhancing the visual quality of images.
