A median filter is a non-linear digital filtering technique used in image processing to reduce noise and preserve edges in an image. It is particularly effective in removing salt-and-pepper noise, which appears as randomly occurring white and black pixels. The median filter replaces the intensity value of each pixel with the median value of the intensities in its neighborhood.

Here are the key steps involved in applying a median filter:

1. **Define a Window (or Kernel):**
   - Choose a square or rectangular window (also called a kernel) of a specified size. Common window sizes are 3x3, 5x5, 7x7, etc. The size of the window determines the neighborhood of each pixel.

2. **Place the Window Over Each Pixel:**
   - Move the window over each pixel in the image, and for each position, consider the pixel values within the window.

3. **Sort Pixel Values:**
   - Arrange the pixel values within the window in ascending order.

4. **Replace Pixel Value:**
   - Replace the intensity value of the central pixel with the median value of the sorted pixel values.

The median filter is particularly effective in removing outliers and impulse noise because the median value is less sensitive to extreme values than the mean. This makes it robust in the presence of salt-and-pepper noise, where a few extremely bright or dark pixels can significantly affect the mean but have little impact on the median.

Here's a simple example to illustrate the process:

Consider a 3x3 window with the following pixel values:

\[ \begin{matrix} 10 & 20 & 15 \\ 5 & 25 & 8 \\ 12 & 18 & 22 \end{matrix} \]

The sorted values are: \[5, 8, 10, 12, 15, 18, 20, 22, 25\]

The median value is the middle value, which is 15. Therefore, the central pixel's value is replaced by 15.

The median filter is widely used in image processing for denoising, and its simplicity and effectiveness make it a popular choice, especially in applications where preserving edges is important. However, one drawback is that it can smooth away fine details and may not be suitable for all types of noise or all image structures.
